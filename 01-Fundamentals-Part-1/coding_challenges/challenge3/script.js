Coding Challenge #3
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculatetheaveragescoreforeachteam,usingthetestdatabelow
2. Comparetheteam'saveragescorestodeterminethewinnerofthecompetition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
as well (draw means they have the same average score)
3. Bonus1:Includearequirementforaminimumscoreof100.Withthisrule,a
team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
4. Bonus2:Minimumscorealsoappliestoadraw!Soadrawonlyhappenswhen both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
